## About
You are an apprentice alchemist and you just destabilized your master's potion! Connect elements into chains to stabilize it before the time runs out and get as many points as you can.

Drag elements from the shelf onto the grid and click "Mix!" when you're done. But watch out, each element can only be mixed under certain conditions! Hover over an element to see its specific rules. Your goal is to make the longest chain possible while following all conditions.
